Autonomous ErgoChair Review Is This Office Chair Worth From thetechreviewer.com</p>
<p>Feels like i am laying in a hammock when leaning back. If you search you would see same chairs for 60$! Quality of the chair is realy good even tough its plastic its heavy and realy sturdy the plastic feels more like piece of metal weight wise stil suprised that this is plastic not gonna lie ps he loves the head rest under work time :p so in short my dad loves it and i hope he can use it for many years to come ^^ and autonomous.ai thank you once. The office chair we are taking a look at today is their ergochair 2, which if you can guess from the name is an ergonomic chair.</p>
<h3 id="with-more-options-than-one-can-know-what-to-do-with-and-a-breathable-back-support-that-is-adjustable-the-ergochair-2-should-be-an-option-for-any-gamer-or-worker-looking-to-make-their-day-a-lot-more-comfortable">With more options than one can know what to do with, and a breathable back support that is adjustable, the ergochair 2 should be an option for any gamer or worker looking to make their day a lot more comfortable.</h3><p>The ergochair 2 is an upgrade to the original autonomous ergonomic chair as the name suggests. Autonomous has decided to use polyester fabric with moulded foam interior and a durable nylon plastic frame and pu hand rest pads as the chair’s materials. Gaming pc gaming reviews autonomous ergochair pro review: What struck me about their products was that they seemed to make good products at a reasonable and accessible price point. Will this be the chair to replace our gaming chair? Autonomous did a great job and i’m having a hard time wondering what to do with the racing chair it’s replacing.</p>

<p>Overall thinkcomputers gives the autonomous kinn chair a 9 out of 10 score. My old chair was falling apart and was less than ideal for spending long hours in.

<p>Right now autonomous is selling this chair for $419, which seems reasonable for a chair that will give you proper posture and one you can fully dial in.

<p>I asked for guidance to finding a product link for it, but alex was amazing and is sending it to me as a gift. Feels like i am laying in a hammock when leaning back.

<p>Overall, the autonomous avochair looks and feels great but it is not as comfortable as other autonomous chairs that i’ve tested. Autonomous intends to help you find your perfect sitting posture with this chair. I added a memory foam cushion that helped but it has got to go! The seat is huge, would fit someone who weighs a lot more.</p>

<p>I did some searching and the autonomous ergochair 2 kept popping up in the top 10 ergonomic chairs. I’d sit in this dump bucket.
