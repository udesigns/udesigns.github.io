<p>Contemporary design is all about smart, hidden, and/or unexpected storage solutions. Think of it this way: Mixed materials used for facades: Instead of having a separate kitchen, dining and living room, contemporary homes have open floor plans, which allow all residents to enjoy the space together without feeling crammed in.

<p>The minimalist villa by ofis is a minimalist house designed for a family in ljubljana. Contemporary homes often create contrast by using a combination of different building materials for the facade. We love contemporary homes for their smart design and curb appeal, and these homes are no exception. Think of it this way: This is what modern design actually is.</p>

<p>Therefore, buildings from the late 20th century to the present moment might be referred. For instance, a contemporary home design might sport a traditional exterior with craftsman touches and a modern open floor plan with the master bedroom on the main level.

<p>Contemporary vs modern home design: Now that we have established the difference between modern and contemporary. Contemporary architecture is the architecture of the 21st century.
