<h3 id="the-most-notable-feature-of-these-trees-is-they-prevent-people-outside-your-garden-from-looking-in">The most notable feature of these trees is they prevent people outside your garden from looking in.</h3><p>If you don’t want to be able to see your neighbor’s yard or you don’t want them peering into yours, tall hedges for privacy are beautiful and a much more affordable option than wooden privacy fences. The special thing about this tall tree species is that it grows so tall, making it an amazing privacy tree choice. This will regenerate them and give you very thick growth if they should become too tall and open. Of course, you could build a fence, but a living wall of trees is so much more attractive. Evergreen trees are the best choice for privacy screens as they don’t lose their leaves in the winter and protect your yard from prying eyes even in cold weather. A good choice is the viburnum tinus, a small leaf evergreen that grows to about 3.5 metres.</p>
