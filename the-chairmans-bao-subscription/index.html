<p>Ooops, it appears you trying to access premium content. I really do enjoy their free content. Bao, or 报, is part of 报纸 (baozhi, newspaper) or 日报 (ribao, daily paper). If you’re new to all things china, chairman mao zedong is an important figure in modern chinese history.</p>

Used it when i first started studying then forgot about it and basically spent a couple hundred on monthly subscriptions before remembering recently i had it. Are there any other similar resources that i left out? A short explanation of the name: Du chinese is a powerful chinese learning app. Good if you read huge quantities of chinese.</p>

<p>Having to pay for bonus content feels a bit wasted if you personally never use it, more so advanced page features. Please create an account with the chairman�s bao in order to use this feature.

Used it when i first started studying then forgot about it and basically spent a couple hundred on monthly subscriptions before remembering.</p>
