Lawnchair Larry, the OG Balloon Man Who Flew Into Federal From autoevolution.com</p>
<p>One day this dream drove him to do something crazy. Sadly, lawnchair larry committed suicide in 1993. After about 45 minutes in the sky, he finally summoned up the courage to begin shooting some of the balloons, until he accidentally dropped his gun overboard.

<h3 id="cnn-david-blaine-just-managed-to-do-what-so-many-can-only-dream-of--flying-up-into-the-air-using-a-bunch-of-balloons">(cnn) david blaine just managed to do what so many can only dream of — flying up into the air using a bunch of balloons.</h3><p>Sadly, lawnchair larry committed suicide in 1993. So larry and his lawn chair were just there flying aimlessly, afraid to pop any of his balloons in the fear that it would return him to. After floating about 16 kilometers (10 mi), from san pedro, california to long beach, he shot out some of the balloons with a pellet gun and landed safely, where he was promptly arrested. The topics in tales from the bottle videos, while bizarre to a comical extent, too often end in tragedy. On october 6, 1993, he hiked into the los angeles national forest and shot himself in the heart. But things didn’t quite turn out as planned.</p>
